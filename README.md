# Daliah - Supply Chain Traceability Using Blockchain Technology

Food is necessary for human survival. As a result, guaranteeing its safety as it passes through food supply chains from farmer to consumer is critical. This can be accomplished by utilizing a food traceability system, which allows for the tracking and tracing of produce across the food supply chain. Due to its capacity to securely store data in a decentralized and tamper-evident manner, blockchain technology has recently shown significant promise in enhancing traceability in food supply chains.
